# AltSchool Second Semester Cloud Engineering Exam

## Project Objective
To create a dynamic prototype of a web application with the requirements listed below for my startup `Thorix_by_Kenny` to showcase my technical skills to investors.

- Provisioning the Server with Ubuntu distribution using an (EC2) or another cloud provider (e.g., DigitalOcean, Azure).
- Web Server Setup install Nginx (preferred) or Apache.
- Dynamic Landing Page (Beyond Static HTML), Create a personalized landing page with:
- Production-Ready Networking & Security 
- Bonus: Secure with Letâ€™s Encrypt SSL (Certbot) and a custom domain.

## Server Setup

**Cloud Provider:** AWS (Amazon Web Services)

### Steps:
1. **Set up base infrastructure**
To begin preparation for this project a base infrastructure of VPC, Subnets, Route table and internet gateway (igw) is required on AWS

- Create a VPC on AWS to include required subnet (public or private)
- Create an internet gateway to enable connection to the internet or endpoints to enable private connections to other services
- Configure route tables to route traffic from your subnets to igw or required endpoint.

With a view of expansion and improved availability for my base infrastructure I created a VPC with 4 subnets (2 private, 2 public), route to the internet through an internet gateway, routes and s3endpoint for my private subnets. You may adopt an alternative approach to setting up your base infrastructure, provided all required components are present and properly configured.

2. **Provision an EC2 Instance with Ubuntu distribution**:
   - Navigate to the EC2 page on the console and select launch instance
   - Select the Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (also compatible with 22.04 LTS).
   - t2.micro (free tier eligible).
   - Create a Security key to facilitate SSH connection
   - Create a security group with appropriate inbound rules to allow:
     - **SSH (Port 22)**
     - **HTTP (Port 80)**
     - **HTTPS (Port 443)**
   - Launched and confirmed instance state
   - Created and allocated an Elastic IP to maintain a consistent address across instance restarts.

3. **Accessed the Server via SSH and setup web server (Nginx)**:
   - SSH into the server by using the command below
   `ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-elastic-ip`
   - Install Nginx
   ```bash 
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nginx -y
   ```
